# ProFitness Goals Tracker
## Set a goal. Track your progress.
This is the github repository for the code used in my Fitness Tracking app. You can set up goals to track success rates. Enter a new goal with Type, Frequency, and Duration. Revisit to check-in your progress and see the calculation of success. For instance, a daily goal set to one week will yield a 100% success rate after 7 check-ins.
